# Create mesh and domain 
 
The Domain and Mesh window in this PyQt5-based application allows users to create a domain and mesh based on their data. Users can customize grid boundaries and finite element density as needed. 

## Generate Domain and Mesh

To create a domain and mesh, follow these steps:

Click the "Choose your file" button to select the data file and click the "Import" button in the "Data" tab to input your geophysical data.

Enter the value of "spinBox_startX", "spinBox_startY", "spinBox_endX", and "spinBox_endY" to generate a domain.

## Save generated figures

If users want to save any domain or mesh they created, simply click the "save" button to save the figures to the local directory.
